# Connect to Bluetooth Multimeter

Get BLE Multimeter data to PC. With approx 2 samples per second (in DC Volt mode).

Works for

* AOPUTTRIVER AP-90EPD

Should also work for, maybe with different "CHARACTERISTIC_UUID"
* HoldPeak HP-90EPD

Multimeters via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) connection *without* prior pairing of the devices.
